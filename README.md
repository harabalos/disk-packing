Disk Packing
===============

This project was developed as part of a third semester course at [AUEB](https://www.aueb.gr/) University, and it focuses on implementing and utilizing data structures such as singly linked list, max priority queues.


The goal of the project is to use these data structures and the greedy and sorting algorithms to solve the bin packing problem about disks. In this simplified version of the problem, we are given a set of N folders with files that need to be placed on hard disks with a capacity of 1 TB each. Each folder is between 0 and 1,000,000 MB (1 TB) in size, and we must store each folder entirely on one disk. The ideal solution is to use the minimum possible number of hard disks.

Project Goals
------------------

- Implement and use a priority queue and singly linked list data structure to solve the problem efficiently.
- Design and implement an algorithm that approaches the optimal solution for the "Bin Packing" problem.
- Analyze the performance of the implemented algorithms and compare them with each other.
